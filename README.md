## How It's Made:

HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, PostgreSQL

## Optimizations

The send request to the server is a bit faulty. As soon as you sumbit the form you are automatically redirected to the confirmation page. This can be fixed by rendering if there is a 404 error from our request, render a message to the user that the form was not successful.

## Lessons Learned:
